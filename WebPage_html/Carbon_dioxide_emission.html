        <p> 
            <b>Carbon dioxide (CO2)</b> is a colourless, odourless and non-poisonous gas formed by combustion
            of carbon and in the respiration of living organisms.
            <b>Carbon dioxide emissions</b> or CO2 emissions
            are emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following visualisation present the data from both <b>development countries</b> and
            <b>developing countries</b> carbon dioxide emission  that explore from interenet,
            Aiming at a <b>map</b>,<b>yearly
            emission</b> for each country, comparsion of development
            & developing countries

            <p>
                The map display the location of countries which are in survey, the <b>Color</b> of the points(Country) are represent
                the <b>Sum</b> of the emission of carbon dioxide in kilotonne(kt), then the <b>Size</b> of the point is their emission level.
                When moving the mouse on the point, the tooplip will present the value in year 2019, then with sum for ten years
                (2010-2019)
            </p>

            <p>
                There are 13 countries in this survey, 7 countries are considered as development countries, 
                others are the country in developing, by a general view, the countries that in the map is: Australia
                New zealand, USA, UK, China, Brazil, Ukraine, Canada, France, Netherland, Japan, Russian, Turkey.
            </p>

            <p>
                By observing the map, although it seems to USA has almost same size(emission level) of point with Russian and China,
                but according to Emission in kt, <CN> China </CN> has the <b>highest</b> emission over ten years.
            </p>

            <p>
                <NZ>New zealand</NZ> has the <b>lowest</b> carbon dioxide emission in there 13 countries, one should be noted that is 
                <NZ>New zealand </NZ>is a <b>development country</b>, the significant country in development countries is <US>USA</US>
                , it contributes <b>54010574 kt</b> in this ten years

            <p>
                As the pie chart shown above, there is a pie chart comparsion about developing & development countries in
                10 years the <b>developing countries</b> are set on left hand side corner, which has the country:
                Turkey, Brazil, China, Russian, Netherland,Ukraine.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's clear that data from <b>developing country</b> is much <b>higher</b> than development country,
                almost take up <b>66%</b> of the total emission in 10 years and development countries take up <b>34%</b>

            <p>
                According to the map and pie chart above, China has contributes a lot to the carbon dioxide emission not only in the
                sum of ten years but also splited in each year, this chart shown that each year the sum of <b>all</b> countries and make 
                comparsion with China, roughly to see that China nearly <b>half</b> of the carbon dioxide emission for all.

                After get a general view, there is a colored graph for each countries and be piled up as the 
                sum of the investigate countries emission in these ten years, the area of each countries represent 
                their contribution to the total in each year, when put on one particular area, the graph will perform
                legend as a reaction.

                The bar chart has directly present each country total emissions in ten years,
                horizontally place this country will shown a comparsion on sight, a estimate
                also can be made by viewing this chart.

                During the Investigation of carbon dioxide emission, a trend line with detailed data for each year
                is imperative for analysis, the Line chart shown above is a interactive line chart, by pressing
